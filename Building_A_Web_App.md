# Building a Web App from zero 

### Which JDK to use? 

* **Oracle JDK:** Often seen as the standard, Oracle's JDK is widely used in enterprise environments. However, it's important to note that Oracle JDK is free for development and testing, but requires a paid license for commercial use in production environments.
* **Amazon Corretto:** An Amazon-provided JDK that's free, multiplatform, and production-ready. It's a good choice if you're developing applications that will be deployed on AWS.

### Maven or Gradle?

* Maven has been around since 2004, while gradle has emerged after 2009, so Maven has more stability. 
* Maven has a vast repository of plugins.
* Maven uses XML for configuration, many developers are comfortable with using pom.xml files.
* Many large organizations adopted Maven early on and have extensive codebases that rely on it.

> Ultimately, the choice between Maven and Gradle often comes down to personal preference, project requirements, and organizational standards. While Maven is more widespread in traditional Java development environments, Gradle is gaining popularity, especially in projects that can benefit from its flexibility and performance optimizations.
